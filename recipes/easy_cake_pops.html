         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>11 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>lollipop sticks</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool cake completely, at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Crumble cake into a large bowl and mix in cream cheese. Roll cake mixture into about 40 to 50 quarter-size balls. Insert a lollipop stick into each cake ball and arrange on a baking sheet; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Dip each cake ball into melted chocolate until coated. Arrange cake pops on a baking sheet to dry.</li>
            </ol>
