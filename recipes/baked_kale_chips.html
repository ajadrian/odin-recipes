        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This chicken tortilla soup with shredded chicken, black beans, and corn is quick to make, full of flavor, and very filling! It's garnished with chopped fresh avocado, Monterey Jack cheese, crushed tortilla chips, and green onion. This soup freezes well.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 bunch kale</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon flaked sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>With a knife or kitchen shears carefully remove kale leaves from the thick stems and tear into bite size pieces. Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner. Drizzle kale leaves with olive oil and toss to combine. Spread out in an even layer on the baking sheet without overlapping and sprinkle with salt.</li>
                <li>Bake until the edges start to brown but are not burnt, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
